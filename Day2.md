# Internet
Today we have learnt about the invetion and history of Intenet And WWW
Internet was invented by Tim Berners Lee
at that time he also invented the browser AND web site to access the  internet with the help of Robert Cailliau
IN 1989 Robert Cailliau supposed the idea of WWW
WWW was offically came in 1989 at CERN
WWW stands for World WIde Web
NeXT Computer was used by Berners Lee for world first web server In 1990
And also the world first web browser WorldWideWeb 

# Web
## Web 1.0
Web 1.0 was from 1986 to 2004
The first iteration of the web represents the web 1.0 which according to Berners-Lee is the read-only web
## Web 2.0
web 2.0 was from 2004 to 2016 onwards
We are now seeing the infancy of web 2.0 or the “read-write” web as Berners-Lee described it
It’s the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users
As examples look at YouTube and MySpace which rely on user submissions
Web 2.0 is a welcome response to web users who want to participate in the information.
## Web 3.0
By extrapolating Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations web 3.0 is read-write-execute
Semantic markup refers to the communication gap between humans and computerized applications
One of the biggest challenges of presenting information on the web is that applications cannot provide context to data and therefore can’t understand what is relevant
# Website
## Types Of Websites
### Static Website
A static website contains Web pages with fixed content
Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor
Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create
### Dynamic Website
Dynamic websites contain Web pages that are generated in real-time
These pages include Web scripting code, such as PHP or ASP
 When a dynamic page is accessed, the code within the page is parsed on the Web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's Web browser
 
 ## Difference Between Static And Dynamic Websites
 #### Code
 The code of a webpage can be either static or dynamic. This is fairly straightforward: static content is content that is hard-coded on a page. Dynamic pages are structured by referencing a CMS or some external database
 #### Delivery
 The delivery of a webpage can also be either static or dynamic. Static delivery is pre-rendered pages that are typically cached and delivered via a content delivery network, or CDN. Dynamic pages are generated in real time at the time of the request by the server
 #### Client Browser
 The browser can also affect whether a site is static or dynamic. Static sites remain the same for all who access it, regardless of browser. Dynamic pages can use client side Javascript to make pages dynamic in real time
 #### Main Difference
 Dynamic sites use server side languages to process requests at the time it’s made and generate a page and its contents in real-time. Static pages are pre-rendered, cached, and delivered to the user And websites integrated with databases powered by languages like Python, PHP, ASP, Ruby, Java, and more. This enabled sites to be dynamic, and display relevant content to the user based on a setting or input
