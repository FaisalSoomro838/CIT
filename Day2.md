# Web
## Web 1.0
Web 1.0 was from 1986 to 2004
The first iteration of the web represents the web 1.0 which according to Berners-Lee is the read-only web
## Web 2.0
web 2.0 was from 2004 to 2016 onwards
We are now seeing the infancy of web 2.0 or the “read-write” web as Berners-Lee described it
It’s the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users
As examples look at YouTube and MySpace which rely on user submissions
Web 2.0 is a welcome response to web users who want to participate in the information.
## Web 3.0
By extrapolating Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations web 3.0 is read-write-execute
Semantic markup refers to the communication gap between humans and computerized applications
One of the biggest challenges of presenting information on the web is that applications cannot provide context to data and therefore can’t understand what is relevant
