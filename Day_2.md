# Internet
Today we have learnt about the invetion and history of Intenet And WWW
<br>Internet was invented by Tim Berners Lee
<br>at that time he also invented the browser AND web site to access the  internet with the help of Robert Cailliau
<br>IN 1989 Robert Cailliau supposed the idea of WWW
<br>WWW was offically came in 1989 at CERN
<br>WWW stands for World WIde Web
<br>NeXT Computer was used by Berners Lee for world first web server In 1990
<br>And also the world first web browser WorldWideWeb 

# Web
- ## Web 1.0
Web 1.0 was from 1986 to 2004
<br>The first iteration of the web represents the web 1.0 which according to Berners-Lee is the read-only web
- ## Web 2.0
web 2.0 was from 2004 to 2016 onwards
<br>We are now seeing the infancy of web 2.0 or the “read-write” web as Berners-Lee described it
<br>It’s the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users
<br>As examples look at YouTube and MySpace which rely on user submissions
<br>Web 2.0 is a welcome response to web users who want to participate in the information.
- ## Web 3.0
By extrapolating Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations web 3.0 is read-write-execute
<br>Semantic markup refers to the communication gap between humans and computerized applications
<br>One of the biggest challenges of presenting information on the web is that applications cannot provide context to data and therefore can’t understand what is relevant
# Website
## Types Of Websites
- ### Static Website
A static website contains Web pages with fixed content
<br>Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor
<br>Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create
- ### Dynamic Website
Dynamic websites contain Web pages that are generated in real-time
<br>These pages include Web scripting code, such as PHP or ASP
<br>When a dynamic page is accessed, the code within the page is parsed on the Web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's Web browser
 
 ## Difference Between Static And Dynamic Websites
 - #### Code
 The code of a webpage can be either static or dynamic. This is fairly straightforward: static content is content that is hard-coded on a page. Dynamic pages are structured      <br>by referencing a CMS or some external database
 - #### Delivery
 The delivery of a webpage can also be either static or dynamic. Static delivery is pre-rendered pages that are typically cached and delivered via a content delivery network, <br>or CDN. Dynamic pages are generated in real time at the time of the request by the server
 - #### Client Browser
 The browser can also affect whether a site is static or dynamic. Static sites remain the same for all who access it, regardless of browser. Dynamic pages can use client side <br>Javascript to make pages dynamic in real time
 - #### Main Difference
 Dynamic sites use server side languages to process requests at the time it’s made and generate a page and its contents in real-time. Static pages are pre-rendered, cached, <br>and delivered to the user And websites integrated with databases powered by languages like Python, PHP, ASP, Ruby, Java, and more. This enabled sites to be dynamic, and <br>display relevant content to the user based on a setting or input
 
 ## Architecture 
 - ### Static Website
 Static sites have consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript that are delivered directly to the user’s browser
 <br>There is no computation involved in creating the page that will be transmitted to the user 
 <br>There is no database that needs to be queried to generate the page
 - ### Dynamic Website
 Dynamic websites have a database, a server, some type of backend scripts, Javascript, HTML files and CSS files
 <br>Dynamic sites serve their data by using scripts to pull data from the database to create or combine with the HTML files that are delivered to the user's browser
